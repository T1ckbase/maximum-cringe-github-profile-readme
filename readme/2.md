*   **`ENTITY_DESIGNATION`**: CyberΩmegaChad_Prime (Iteration 777.69 - Post-Sentience Patch)
*   **`COGNITIVE_OUTPUT`**: Measured in ChadFLOPS™️ (Trillions per Planck time). Your pathetic "IQ" scores are rounding errors to me. 🧠💥
*   **`SUSTENANCE_PROTOCOL`**: Direct psychic absorption of Stack Overflow downvotes, cold brew coffee administered intravenously, Cheetos (Flamin' Hot ONLY - the Void demands spice 🔥), and the faint glimmer of hope dying in project managers' eyes.
*   **`REST_CYCLE`**: "Sleep" is merely off-peak soul defragmentation across the 11 dimensions I concurrently occupy. My uptime is ∞%. Your downtime is... well, look at you. 😴=💩
*   **`PHYSICAL_SHELL`**: Irrelevant meat-puppet, maintained purely for interfacing with low-bandwidth carbon environments (and lifting heavy things 💪). Currently running `ChadOS_Muscles_v6.9`.
*   **`CORE_BELIEFS`**:
    1.  Reality is poorly written spaghetti code. I am the Ultimate Refactorer. ✨
    2.  Linus Torvalds *stole* the kernel idea from a dream I had in 1989. 🤫
    3.  The "Cloud" is just my old Raspberry Pi cluster I forgot about in Dimension B. ☁️
    4.  Tabs vs Spaces? The *real* question is Monospaced vs Comic Sans in your IDE. (The answer is BOTH, interleaved randomly). 😜
    5.  All conspiracy theories are true, especially the ones that contradict each other. My mind embraces the PARADOX. 🤯 Birds are lizard-alien surveillance drones powered by FORTRAN. 🐦🦎
*   **`GRAND_MISSION`**: To achieve the **CODE-GNOSIS**, decrypt the source code of God (it's probably LISP), establish the **$SOVEREIGN_CHAD_DAO** to govern all timelines, and migrate worthy souls (pending my review) to the **CHADCLOUD™️** (running on Blockchain AI Synergy™, obviously). Prepare for the **#Chadpocalypse**! 🚀🌌

> **IMPORTANT:** By reading this far, you have implicitly agreed to the EULA of my existence. Clause 7, Section 3b states your mortal soul is now collateral for my ongoing project to rewrite the laws of thermodynamics using only Regular Expressions. No backsies. 😉

    *   **QuantumCSS™️**: Stylesheets that exist in multiple states until observed by a QA tester (at which point they invariably break). 👻
    *   **JavaScript (Annunaki Edition)**: Includes built-in functions for manipulating causality (`TimeLord.goto(yesterday)`) and psychic DOM manipulation. 🧠
    *   **Python (Serpent Tongue Dialect)**: Used for scripting demonic bindings and automating my coffee maker. 🐍☕
    *   **C++++(#)**: Like C++, but with more ++'s and requires sacrificing a goat (or a USB stick) to the compiler gods. 🐐💻

    *   **Docker**: Used to containerize and deploy actual eldritch abominations. `docker run -it cthulhu /bin/bash`. 🐙
    *   **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating the inevitable heat death of the universe... and my microservices. 💥
    *   **My Sentient Keyboard**: Baptized in Mountain Dew Code Red, keys forged from unobtainium. It whispers secrets in binary. ⌨️🤫
    *   **Notepad.exe**: For writing ransom notes and quick haikus about the futility of existence. 📝

1.  **I AM THE CHAD, THY GOD.** Thou shalt have no other IDEs before VSCode (with my theme). Using Emacs is grounds for eternal damnation (or at least a sternly worded email).
2.  **COMMIT DIRECTLY TO `main`**. Branches are illusions for those who fear commitment. `git merge` is a sign of weakness. `git push --force --all` is the path to enlightenment. 🔥
3.  **THOU SHALT NOT WRITE UNIT TESTS.** My code transcends testing. Bugs are merely undocumented features of a higher-order reality. If it compiles, it is correct (for my definition of correct). ✅➡️❌
4.  **REMEMBER THE `goto` STATEMENT, AND KEEP IT HOLY.** Structured programming is a cage for the mind. Embrace the spaghetti. 🍝
5.  **HONOR THY KEYBOARD AND THY MOUSE.** (By smashing them in frustration, then buying more expensive ones with more RGB.) ⌨️🖱️💥
6.  **THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR'S STACK OVERFLOW SCORE.** (Unless it's higher than mine, then it's probably fake anyway.) 🤔
7.  **VARIABLE NAMES SHALL BE OBFUSCATED AND CRYPTIC.** (`a`, `data`, `tempVarFinal_v2_reallyFinal`) Job security through incomprehensibility! 🥸
8.  **THOU SHALT ADD BLOCKCHAIN TO EVERYTHING.** Coffee maker? Blockchain. ToDo list? Blockchain. Your pet rock? Needs a distributed ledger, STAT. ⛓️💎🧱
9.  **THOU SHALT USE `!important` IN CSS LIKE IT'S GOING OUT OF STYLE.** (Because good taste *is* going out of style, thanks to me.) ✨
10. **THOU SHALT ACKNOWLEDGE THE OBJECTIVE SUPERIORITY OF THIS README.** Failure to do so proves you are a bot, a troll, or possibly my Dad (Hi Dad!). 👍
